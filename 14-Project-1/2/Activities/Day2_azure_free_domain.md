  - **Create a key vault.** 

  - **Create a self-signed certificate.**

  - **Analyze a self-signed certificate.**

  - **Analyze a trusted certificate.**

  - **Answer review questions.**

⚠️ Note: Since you selected a free Azure domain, Azure will provide a trusted certificate for your domain. You will analyze the difference between self-signed and trusted SSL certificates.
